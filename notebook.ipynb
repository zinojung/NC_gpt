      "Great choice! Indian cuisine is known for its bold flavors and aromatic spices. Let's start with a classic and popular dish - Chicken Tikka Masala. Here's a simple recipe for you to try at home:\n",
      "\n",
      "Ingredients:\n",
      "- 1 lb boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut into bite-sized pieces\n",
      "- 1 cup plain yogurt\n",
      "- 2 tablespoons lemon juice\n",
      "- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil\n",
      "- 1 onion, finely chopped\n",
      "- 3 cloves garlic, minced\n",
      "- 1-inch piece of ginger, grated\n",
      "- 1 can (14 oz) diced tomatoes\n",
      "- 2 tablespoons tomato paste\n",
      "- 1 tablespoon garam masala\n",
      "- 1 teaspoon ground cumin\n",
      "- 1 teaspoon ground coriander\n",
      "- 1 teaspoon paprika\n",
      "- 1/2 teaspoon turmeric\n",
      "- 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper (adjust to taste)\n",
      "- Salt and pepper to taste\n",
      "- Fresh cilantro, chopped for garnish\n",
      "- Cooked rice or naan bread for serving\n",
      "\n",
      "Instructions:\n",
      "1. In a bowl, combine the yogurt, lemon juice, 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil, half of the minced garlic, half of the grated ginger, and a pinch of salt. Add the chicken pieces and mix well to coat. Cover and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour, or overnight for best results.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C). Thread the marinated chicken pieces onto skewers and place them on a baking sheet lined with foil. Bake for 20-25 minutes or until the chicken is cooked through.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. In a large skillet, heat the remaining tablespoon of vegetable oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Add the remaining garlic and ginger, and cook for another minute.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Stir in the diced tomatoes, tomato paste, garam masala, cumin, coriander, paprika, turmeric, cayenne pepper, salt, and pepper. Simmer for 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "6. Serve the Chicken Tikka Masala over cooked rice or with naan bread. Garnish with fresh cilantro before serving.\n",
      "\n",
      "Enjoy your homemade Chicken Tikka Masala! Feel free to adjust the spice levels to suit your taste preferences.As a vegetarian chef specialized in making traditional recipes vegetarian, I can offer you a delicious alternative to Chicken Tikka Masala using paneer instead of chicken.

      "\n",
      "Ingredients:\n",
      "- 1 lb paneer, cut into bite-sized pieces\n",
      "- 1 cup plain yogurt\n",

      "- Salt and pepper to taste\n",
      "- Fresh cilantro, chopped for garnish\n",
      "- Cooked rice or naan bread for serving\n",
      "\n",
      "Instructions:\n",
      "1. Follow the same marinating process as the original recipe, but instead of chicken, marinate the paneer pieces in the yogurt, lemon juice, vegetable oil, garlic, ginger, and salt mixture. Let it marinate for at least 1 hour.\n",
      "2. Bake the marinated paneer in the oven as you would with the chicken, until it is slightly golden and cooked through.\n",
      "3. Proceed with the recipe by sautéing the onion, garlic, and ginger in a skillet, then adding the diced tomatoes, tomato paste, and spices.\n",
      "4. Add the baked paneer to the skillet and simmer to allow the flavors to blend together.\n",
      "5. Serve the Paneer Tikka Masala over rice or with naan bread, garnished with fresh cilantro.\n",
