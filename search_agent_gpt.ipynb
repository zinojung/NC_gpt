      "\u001b[0m\u001b[36;1m\u001b[1;3mA malicious update to xz Utils, a widely used Linux compression tool, was caught before it could infect millions of devices. The backdoor manipulated SSH connections and could have allowed code execution by a predetermined key. On March 28, 2024 a backdoor was identified in XZ Utils. This vulnerability, CVE-2024-3094 with a CVSS score of 10 is a result of a software supply chain compromise impacting versions 5.6.0 and 5.6.1 of XZ Utils. The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has recommended organizations to downgrade to a previous non-compromised XZ Utils version. Learn about the XZ Utils backdoor, a sophisticated RCE vulnerability that affects many Linux distributions. Find out how to identify and downgrade the affected packages, and what other steps you can take to protect your systems. That operation matches the style of the XZ Utils backdoor far more than the cruder supply chain attacks of APT41 or Lazarus, by comparison. \"It could very well be someone else,\" says Aitel. A malicious code inserted by a developer into a Linux compression format exposed millions of systems to a remote log-in compromise. Learn how a Microsoft worker discovered the backdoor and prevented a massive cyber attack.\u001b[0m\u001b[32;1m\u001b[1;3mThe XZ Utils backdoor refers to a malicious update to xz Utils, a widely used Linux compression tool.
