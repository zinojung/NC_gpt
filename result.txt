The XZ backdoor refers to a malicious code that was added to the XZ Utils versions 5.6.0 and 5.6.1, which modified the way the software functions. The backdoor manipulated sshd, the executable file used to make remote connections. This backdoor exploited the SSH protocol to gain remote access and control over affected devices. The xz-utils package, used by many Linux distributions, had a backdoor that could compromise sshd authentication. A Microsoft worker discovered the backdoor and alerted the open source community, preventing a major disaster.
